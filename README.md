# sandbox
For testing branching, merging, pull requests, permissions, etc.



I think I currently have ownership of this repo. What that means is that if you want to make an edit, you can "clone" the repo to your computer, make your changes and then submit a "pull request". A pull request is essentially you asking for your changes to be merged into another branch (the master branch for example). If I do have full rights, then you should not be able to do this - give it a go!

Basic things to play with then if you're not familiar with github:

  * Make your own repository (repo) from scratch
  * Clone somebody else's repo
  * Make a new branch and edit the code
  * Try to merge it into the master branch
  * Submit a pull request
  * Submit a bug report
